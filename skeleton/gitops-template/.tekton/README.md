# Gitops Pipelines

## Gitops Repository Pull-Request Checker 
 
This pipeline is used to validate pull-requests into the gitops repository. This runner will call the gitops-pull-request pipeline which will validate the images being updated. Its' designed to be used for promotion flows, where the state of one environment is being promoted to the successor environment (dev to stage, or stage to prod).

Tasks references come from this repository ` ../pipelines` `../tasks` and are referenced by URL using the git resolver in tekton. 
 
When the pipleines in this repo are updated, all future runs in existin pipelines are shared.

A developer can override these tasks with a local copy and updated annotations. 

Example 

To override the git-clone task, you may simply copy the git reference into your .tekton directory and then reference it from the remote task annotation. 

`pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/task-0: "./tekton/git-clone.yaml"` 
   

## Templates 
These pipelines are in template format. The references to this repository in the PaC template is `{{values.rawUrl}}` which is updated to point to this repo or the fork of this repo.

The intent of the template is to be able to fork this repository and update its use in the Developer Hub templates directory.
